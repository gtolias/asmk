# Aggregated Selective Match Kernels (ASMK) for Image Retrieval

This is a Matlab package that we provide to reproduce the results 
of our ICCV 2013 paper. This code implements the ASMK* method, 
which offers the best trade-off between search accuracy and resource
 requirements (memory and speed). We additionally provide the code to 
reproduce the ASMK* results using DELF descriptors in our CVPR 2018 paper.

# Prerequisites

The prerequisites are automatically downloaded when running the main scripts.

# Running (ICCV 2013)

To reproduce the experiments in our ICCV 2013 paper using Hessian Affine features and
SIFT descriptors launch the test program in matlab:
```
>> test_asmk
```

# Running (CVPR 2018)

To reproduce the experiments in our CVPR 2018 paper using [DELF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06321) descriptors 
launch the following commands in matlab:

```
>> cd revisitop
>> setup
>> create_index
>> search_index
```
